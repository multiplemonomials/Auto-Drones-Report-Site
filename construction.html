					The control code needed needed to operate a multi-rotor drone is very complicated, much more so than a regular airplane.
					First, to keep the drone level, the controller must constantly monitor the gyroscope and make minute adjustments to the speed of each 
					propeller.  Second, to move horizontally, the propellers on one side of the drone must be sped up, which tilts that side up.  This tilting,
					as well as the acceleration it causes, must also be fed into the leveling algorithm so that the drone doesn't tip over.  Finally, to
					turn the drone, the propellers that spin one direction
					are sped up, and the ones that spin the other way are slowed down.  To further complicate things, all of these functions require complex PID (Proportional Integral
					Derivative) control algorithms so that they remain as stable as possible.  These algorithms must be carefully tuned for each and every drone using them,
					and require knowledge of calculus to understand.  So, the nature of multicopters mandates that they have quite complicated control programs.
