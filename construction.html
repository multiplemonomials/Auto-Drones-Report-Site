					<h3> Anatomy of a Quadcopter </h3>
					<p>
						Multi-rotor drones use a mix of standard radio-control plane parts and custom-designed hardware.  The best way to
						explain it is to use this image of a quadcopter as an example.
					</p>
					<span class="imagelistnumber">1. Brushless Motor</span>
					<p>
						Quadcopters usually use small brushless motors for their propellers.  These motors are popular for use in planes and copters
						because they have no moving parts, so they are resistant to failure.  However, because of this, they
						require a speed control circuit to create the electric pulses required to make them move.  The upside, though, is that
						the speed control has very fine-grain control over the the motor, allowing propeller speed to be precisely controlled. 
					</p>
					<span class="imagelistnumber">2. Battery</span>
					<p>
						Personal drones, like other remote-control vehicles, usually use high-capacity lithium batteries for power.  Previously,
						planes had to use NiCad and NiMH batteries.  These batteries were so much heavier than the new lithium ones that older hobbyist designs which used 
						them for ballast would become unbalanced without them.  Importantly for drones, though, lithium batteries can pack 17 watt-hours into just 129g,
						providing tens of minutes of flight on a charge.
					</p>
					
					<span class="imagelistnumber">3. Prop Saver</span>
					<p>
						When drones crash, usually the propellers take the brunt of the impact.  While some drones use plastic guards to surround
						their propellers, this one uses a rubber band to attack the prop to the motor.  This band is called a prop saver, and allow sht peop to turn and flex in
						a crash.
					</p>
					
					<span class="imagelistnumber">4. Controller</span>
					<p>
						Drones require a controller circuit to control their flight.  This one includes the bar minimum for flight, an 
						accelerometer and a gyroscope.  Other drones use barometric pressure sensors, compasses, and even GPS sensors to intelligently
						control their position.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						There are a variety of drone CPUs in use today.  They range from tiny 8-bit AVR (Arduino) microcontrollers, to full-blown
						Raspberry Pi-like embedded Linux computers.  This particular board uses a moderately powerful 32-bit ARM processor.
					</p>
					
					<span class="imagelistnumber">5. R/C Receiver</span>
					<p>
						Since this is a teleoperated drone, it uses a microwave R/C receiver to receive commands from its driver.  Since this receiver 
						is designed for planes, not drones, it outputs PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) signals, which are meant for driving servos.  The
						controller board reads these signals and steers the drone using them.  Newer receivers use a protocol called PPM (Pulse 
						Position Modulation), which lets the receiver transmit many control inputs at once to the control board using a single set of wires.
					</p>

				<h2>Software</h2>
        <p>
					The control code needed needed to operate a multi-rotor drone is very complicated, much more so than a regular airplane.
					First, to keep the drone level, the controller must constantly monitor the gyroscope and make minute adjustments to the speed of each 
					propeller.  Second, to move horizontally, the propellers on one side of the drone must be sped up, which tilts that side up.  This tilting,
					as well as the acceleration it causes, must also be fed into the leveling algorithm so that the drone doesn't tip over.  Finally, to
					turn the drone, the propellers that spin one direction
					are sped up, and the ones that spin the other way are slowed down.  To further complicate things, all of these functions require complex PID (Proportional Integral
					Derivative) control algorithms so that they remain as stable as possible.  These algorithms must be carefully tuned for each and every drone using them,
					and require knowledge of calculus to understand.  So, the nature of multicopters mandates that they have quite complicated control programs.
