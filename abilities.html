        <h2>Computer Vision</h2>
        <p>
          Recently, people have experimented with the combination of computer vision technology and autonomous drones.
          One example of this is the popular Parrot AR drone.  This drone uses an embedded Linux processor to analyze the
          feed from the built-in camera and send it to a smart device.  This technology enables it
          to become truly autonomous and react to the world around it without any input from humans.
        </p> 
        <p>
          One use of computer vision on drones is tracking things visually.  Every day, computer algorithms get better and better at identifying objects. 
          At the same time, the computing hardware required to run these algorithms becomes smaller and lighter.  The possible
          applications of "seeing" drones can range from the benign, such as cameras that follow people and scientific observation devices,
          to the nefarious, such as face recognition and tracking.  Governments are currently funding programs for drones
					that use facial recognition software to identify people.  Soon, drones will be able to
          capture faces from a long distance and instantly learn about their target in great detail (Conte 2013).
        </p>
        <p>
          Another use of drone-integrated computer vision is speed tracking.  In order to measure their speed, most drones use
          accelerometer sensors.  However, these sensors are prone to inaccuracy, so they can't be used to estimate relative position.
          Instead, the Parrot tracks features on the ground using its camera, allowing it to measure absolute speed better.
          This metric can be jittery and unreliable though, so it is often mathematically combined with the more stable accelerometer
          reading to result in a more accurate speed measurement (Bristeau 2011).

        <p>
					Drones are also commonly equipped with GPS sensors.  As you know, GPS receivers triangulate their coordinates by measuring the distance
					to GPS satellites orbiting the Earth.  This measurement is accurate to within ten to thirty feet, enabling drones to fairly
					reliably discern their position.  When combined with a compass sensor, it lets drones fly a set path completely autonomously.
				</p>
				<p>
					This functionality is popular for recreational drones because it's fun to play with.  Using mapping software like the one pictured above, 
					people can tell their drone where to go and what to do when it gets there.  Some even hold races or competitions involving set-path drones.
				</p>
				<p>
					GPS on drones is also a core part of many autonomous drone applications, especially those which involve long-distance flight.
					For instance, scientific and agricultural applications all require the drone to
					be able to reliably position itself in the air over crops or things being studied.
					Delivery drones, as well, need to be able to navigate for themselves, though they probably need higher accuracy 
					than can be obtained through GPS alone.
