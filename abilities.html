        <h2>Computer Vision</h2>
        <p>
          Recently, people have experimented with the combination of computer vision technology and autonomous drones.
          One example of this is the popular Parrot AR drone.  This drone uses an embedded Linux processor to analyze the
          feed from the built-in camera, as well as send it to a smart device.  In general, this technology allows drones 
          to become truly autonomous and react to the world around them without any input from humans.
        </p> 
        <p>
          One use of this is tracking things.  Every day, computer algorithms get better and better at identifying objects. 
          At the same time, the computing hardware required to run these algorithms becomes smaller and lighter.  The possible
          applications of this can range from the benign, such as cameras that follow people and scientific observation devices,
          to the nefarious, such as face identification and tracking.  Even now, governments are funding programs which allow
          drones to take a picture of someone and match their face with people in a database.  Soon, drones will be able to
          capture faces from a long distance and instantly learn about their target in great detail (Conte 2013).
        </p>

          Another use of drone-integrated computer vision is speed tracking.  In order to measure their speed, most drones use
          accelerometer sensors.  However, these sensors are prone to inaccuracy, so they can't be used to estimate relative position.
          Instead, the Parrot tracks features on the ground using its camera, allowing it to measure absolute speed better.
          This metric can be jittery and unreliable though, so it is often mathematically combined with the more stable accelerometer
          reading to result in a more accurate speed measurement (Bristeau 2011).
