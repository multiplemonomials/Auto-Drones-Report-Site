        <h2>Computer Vision</h2>
        <p>
          Recently, people have experimented with the combination of computer vision technology and autonomous drones.
          One example of this is the popular Parrot AR drone.  This drone uses an embedded Linux processor to analyze the
          feed from the built-in camera and send it to a smart device.  This technology enables it
          to become truly autonomous and react to the world around it without any input from humans.
        </p> 
        <p>
          One use of computer vision on drones is tracking things visually.  Every day, computer algorithms get better and better at identifying objects. 
          At the same time, the computing hardware required to run these algorithms becomes smaller and lighter.  The possible
          applications of "seeing" drones can range from the benign, such as cameras that follow people and scientific observation devices,
          to the nefarious, such as face recognition and tracking.  Governments are currently funding programs for drones
					that use facial regognition software to identify people.  Soon, drones will be able to
          capture faces from a long distance and instantly learn about their target in great detail (Conte 2013).
        </p>

          Another use of drone-integrated computer vision is speed tracking.  In order to measure their speed, most drones use
          accelerometer sensors.  However, these sensors are prone to inaccuracy, so they can't be used to estimate relative position.
          Instead, the Parrot tracks features on the ground using its camera, allowing it to measure absolute speed better.
          This metric can be jittery and unreliable though, so it is often mathematically combined with the more stable accelerometer
          reading to result in a more accurate speed measurement (Bristeau 2011).
