        <h1> Drone Regulations </h1>
        <p>
          With the recent advent of autonomous drones as a product for the masses, governments have been struggling to create rules for how they can and
          can't be used.  The FAA (Federal Aviation Administration), which is the organization responsible for the development of drone-flight regulations,
					has released a preliminary list of rules to manage UAV traffic and protect the general public from drone crashes. However, these laws are actively
					being debated and refined, generally favouring the more restrictive.
        </p>
				
        <h2>Preliminary Regulations</h2>
				<ul>
					<li> All model aircraft must fly below 400 feet </li>
					<li> Aircraft must remain in line-of-sight and be flown during the day. </li>
					<li> Aircraft must stay clear of stadiums, airports and other manned aircraft. </li>
					<li> Licences are required for flying commercially.</li>
					<li> Model aircraft should stay under 55 pounds.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Most of the above regulations can be bypassed with special permission.
					Commercial drone operation is predicted to require the acquisition of special 
					aeronautical knowledge certification, which must be renewed once a year.
					One must be 17 or older to receive a license.
				</p>
				
        <h2> Why Regulate? </h2>
        <p>
          Many people view government regulations as wet blankets that limit their freedom to do what they want, so they are hostile
					to the idea of the government regulating drones.  However, there have been several occasions, both intentional and accidental,
					when a drone caused a scare or put people in (some) danger. 
          For example, in December 2014, a drone flying near Heathrow Airport nearly crashed into a landing plane.
          It didn't actually damage the plane, but there was a possibility of a moderately serious crash (Brown 2014).
					In another case, a drone carrying radioactive sand was landed on top of the Prime Minister's office in Tokyo (Kravets 2015).
					This was a political protest of nuclear power more than anything, and it didn't harm anyone.  Finally, drones can also be used to spy on people, 
					and some businesses claim that drones give their competitors an unfair advantage.
        </p>
				<p>
					So, are the regulations that the FAA has proposed a good idea, or are they overly restrictive?  It certainly seems like
					their main focus is stopping people from getting hurt by a malfeasant drone.  Then again, is there really enough
					evidence to justify the assumption that civilian drones can cause trouble if not restricted?  There's no definitive
					answer to this question, and people need to decide for themselves whether or not these regulations are justified.
