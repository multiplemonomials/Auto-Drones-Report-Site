        <h1> Drone Regulations </h1>
        <p>
          With the recent advent of autonomous drones as a product for the masses, governments have been struggling to create rules for how they can and
          can't be used.  The FAA (Federal Aviation Administration), which is the organization responsible for the development of drone-flight regulations,
					has released a preliminary list of rules to manage UAV traffic and protect the general public from drone crashes. However, these laws are actively
					being debated and refined, generally favouring the more restrictive.
        </p>
				
        <h2>Preliminary Regulations</h2>
				<p>
					&#8226 All model aircraft must fly below 400 feet
				</p>
				<p>
					&#8226 Aircraft must remain in line-of-sight and be flown during the day.
				</p>
				<p>
					&#8226 Aircraft must stay clear of stadiums, airports and other manned aircraft.
				</p>
				<p>
					&#8226 Licences are required for flying commercially.
				</p>
				<p>
					&#8226 Model aircraft should stay under 55 pounds.
				</p>
				<p>
					Most of the above regulations can be bypassed with special permission.
					Commercial drone operation is predicted to require the acquisition of special 
					aeronautical knowledge certification, which must be renewed once a year.
					One must be 17 or older to receive a license.
				</p>
				
        <h2> Why Regulate? </h2>
        <p>
          In general, people view government regulations as wet blankets that limit people's freedom to do what they want.  However, 
          there have been several occasions, both intentional and accidental, when a drone caused a scare or put people in (some) danger.  So, regulation of drones may in fact be warranted.
          For example, in December 2014, a drone flying near Heathrow Airport nearly crashed into a landing plane.
          It didn't cause damage, but if it <em>had</em> hit the plane,
          it could have been bad (Brown 2014).  In another case, a drone carrying radioactive sand was landed on top of the Diet Building in Tokyo.
