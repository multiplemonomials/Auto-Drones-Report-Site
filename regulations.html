        <h1> Drone Regulations </h1>
        <p>
          With the recent advent of autonomous drones as a product for the masses, governments have been struggling to create rules for how they can and
          can't be used.
        </p>
        
        <h2> Why Regulate? </h2>
        <p>
          In general, people view government regulations as wet blankets that limit people's freedom to do what they want.  However, 
          there have been several times, both intentional and accidental, when a drone caused a scare or put people in (some) danger.  So, regulation of drones may in fact be warranted.
          For example, in December 2014, a drone flying near Heathrow Airport nearly crashed into a landing plane.
          It didn't cause damage, but if it <em>had</em> hit the plane,
          it could have been bad (Brown 2014).  In another case, a drone carrying radioactive sand was landed on top of the Diet Building in Tokyo.
