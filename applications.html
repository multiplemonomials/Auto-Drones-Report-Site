				<p>
				As drone technology improves, useful applications of it expand as well. 
				One major use of drones is wildlife surveillance. Drones are in many situations less
				noticeable and more manoeuvrable than human beings, so they can be used to safely track and
				record endangered wildlife without disturbing the animals or endangering humans. Many
				public projects exist to bring survey drones to places like Nigeria and the Russian tundras.
				These drones fly set paths across miles of wildlife reserves, mapping out entire ecosystems,
				helping to find and prevent illegal logging and even scanning the oceans to monitor marine
				ecosystems.
				</p>
				<p>
				The government is excluded from obeying most drone restrictions and may use UAVs to survey enemy territories and scan for soldiers.
				It can also use drones in domestic areas for security and surveillance of public areas such as banks, markets and prisons.

        <h3> Delivery Drones </h3>
        <p>
				Soon after its emergence, drone technology was adapted by the military to transport medical kits
				to front-line troops. More recently, drones are planned to be used for commercial delivery.
				One example of this is Amazon's PrimeAir, which brings parcels directly to the customer's
				front door. However, this program is facing legal issues, because the drones would be flying
				out of sight and over streets and residential areas. Other issues with Amazon's service include drop-off, as not
				all houses have available drop-off zones, and security, as gusts of wind may cause the drones
				and packages to go flying into the heads of unknowing pedestrians.
